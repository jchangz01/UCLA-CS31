In the program, original.cpp, I inputed 0 for the people surveyed, 0 for the people who supported impeachment, and 0 for the ones who did not support 
impeachment. The code outputs that "More people oppose impeachment than support it" which is incorrect because nobody submitted a reponse for the survey.
To begin, I created a logic error by switching the comparison operator in line 30 of the code. I changed the comparison for the "forImpeachment" and "antiImpeachment" variables
from greater than to less than. Doing this resulted in the code producing an incorrect final statement. To specify, when there are more people who support impeachment, 
the output of the program will be that more people oppose it (vice-versa). The two logical errors I introduced into this program were from removing a semicolon after the 
declaration of "numberSurveyed" and the quotation marks from the string of text following cout. The compiler states that a semicolon should precede int meaning that there
should be an identification where that line of code ends. On the other hand, the absence of quotations on a cout command tells the compiler to print out each invidual word 
as a variable instead of the desired text. As a result, a message is generated saying "'How': Undeclared identifier". This tells us that 'How' is not an initialized variable
thus resulting in an error.
