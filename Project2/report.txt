a. The biggest obstacle when creating this project was learning how
intake information from the project specs and processing that info into 
code. For the most part, the instructions and requirements were very
clear; however, I didn't really understand some parts of the project specs.
To specify, I was confused by the line that stated "that one line you write 
must be in one of the following four forms; the text must be identical 
to what is shown, except that italicized items are replaced as 
appropriate:" and the examples that followed. To clarify on what needed to 
be added to my code, I asked my TA during my discussion.
